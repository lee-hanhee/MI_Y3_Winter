        \item How do we optimize without gradients?
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Heuristics such as grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, grad student.
        \end{itemize}
        \item How does Bayesian Optimization work? (in a nut shell)
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Model the complex objective function with a surrogate model (GP), and optimize the surrogate model by using the max and min of the acquistion to find the next point to evaluate on the objective function and get the uncertainty of the surrogate model.
        \end{itemize}
        \item How do we learn on data without labels?
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Unsupervised learning, self-supervised learning, semi-supervised learning, transfer learning, multi-task learning, meta-learning.
